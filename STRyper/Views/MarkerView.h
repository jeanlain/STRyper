/// A `MarkerView` shows molecular marker (``Mmarker`` objects)  using ``RegionLabel`` objects.

/// A `MakerView` can make its ``traceView`` zoom to the range of a marker. It has two navigation buttons to that effect.

/// Since it is subview of a ruler view, a marker view does not scroll, but makes as if it does by moving marker labels to reflect the scrolling position of its associated ``traceView``.
/// In effect, its ``LabelView/visibleOrigin`` properties is simply taken from its ``traceView``.
