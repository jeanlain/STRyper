/// A `VScaleView` shows tick-marks and labels. Theses constitute the vertical axis of the plot containing fluorescent curves drawn by the trace view.
/// The labels represent fluorescent levels of traces.
///
/// - Important: the positioning of the labels assumes that the bottom edge of the `VScaleView` is at the bottom edge of its superview.
/// To be properly positioned, the `VSCaleView` must be a subview of a ``TraceScrollView``. This scroll view creates a `VScaleView` when a ``TraceView`` is set as its `documentView`.
