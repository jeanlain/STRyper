///	A `VScaleView` shows tick-marks and labels. Theses constitute the vertical axis of the plot containing fluorescent curves drawn by the trace view.
///	The labels represent fluorescent levels of traces.
///
///	IMPORTANT: the positioning of the labels assumes that the bottom edge of the `VScaleView` is at the bottom edge of its superview.
///	To be properly positioned, the `VSCaleView` must be a subview of a ``TraceScrollView``. In fact, this scroll view creates a `VScaleView` when a ``TraceView`` is set as its `documentView`.
