/// A view that shows the vertical (fluorescence) scale of a ``TraceView`` and allows the user to modify this scale by clicking & dragging the mouse.
///
///	A `VScaleView` shows tick-marks and labels. Theses constitute the vertical axis of the plot containing fluorescent curves drawn by the trace view.
///	The labels represent fluorescent levels of traces.
///
///	IMPORTANT: the positioning of the labels assumes that is bottom edge of the `VScaleView` is at the bottom edge of its superview.
///	To be properly positioned, the `VSCaleView` must be a subview of a ``TraceScrollView``.

/// While fluorescent levels are coded as short integer number (see ``Trace``), this method returns a float as the result is often used in floating point operations.

/// This method uses the ``Trace/peaks`` attribute of traces, and returns 0 if no peak is found in the `range`.
/// - Parameters:
///   - traces: The trace in which to look for peaks.
///   - range: The range within which peaks are considered.
///   - useRawData: Whether the fluorescence data to use should be retrieved from ``Trace/rawData``. If `NO`, the data is that returned by ``Trace/adjustedDataMaintainingPeakHeights:`` without maintaining peak heights.
///   - ignoreCrosstalk: Wether peaks resulting from crosstalk are ignored.
