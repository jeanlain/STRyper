/// An entity that defines the size range that alleles of the same genetic locus (molecular marker) can take.
///
///	The range of a marker is used do determine if a `Peak` detected in a trace indicates the presence of an allele at a given locus.
///	A marker also has ``bins`` that define the expected range of each allele of the locus.
///
/// Marker are organized in panels (``Panel`` objects).
///	A marker also has a ``channel`` that represents the fluorescent dye used to amplify the locus.
///
/// A marker must not overlap other markers of the same ``panel`` and ``channel``.
///
///	A marker can be copied to the paste board and accessed with in `MarkerPasteboardType` key.
///	It is copied as an archive that can be decoded with an NSKeyedUnarchiver.
///	Its ``stringRepresentation`` can also be accessed with the `NSPasteboardTypeString` key.
