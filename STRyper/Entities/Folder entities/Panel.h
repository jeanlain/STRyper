/// A set of molecular markers that are analyzed conjointly.
///
///	A `Panel` allows analyzing chromatograms that represent the migration of amplicons from one or several molecular markers.
/// When a panel is applied to a sample (``Chromatogram``), a genotype is generated for each of the ``markers`` composing the panel.
/// This means that the sample has a ``Genotype`` object for each of these markers.
///
/// Although the `Panel` class inherits from ``Folder`` for practical reasons, a panel must not have ``Folder/subfolders``.
/// Its ``Folder/parent`` should be a ``PanelFolder`` object.
///
/// - Note: ``CodingObject/encodeWithCoder:``  and ``CodingObject/initWithCoder:``  are currently implement in the context of a ``SampleFolder`` unarchiving/archiving,
/// in that the ``Folder/parent`` of the receiver is encoded/decoded.
