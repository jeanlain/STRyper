/// A view that allows the user to define criteria for sorting objects.
///
/// A `SortCriteriaEditor` can be used to display or generate an array of sort descriptors (`NSSortDescriptor` objects).
/// It represents each sort descriptor as a row, which includes a popup button to select among attributes (key paths) that are available for sorting objects,
/// a segmented control defining the sort order, and buttons to add or remove a sort descriptor (row).
///
/// The order of rows represents the order of the sort criteria by decreasing priority, and can be changed by click & drag.

/// The delegate of the receiver.
@property (weak) IBOutlet id<SortCriteriaEditorDelegate> delegate;


/// Configures the receiver with available sort descriptors for sorting, and user-facing titles.
///
/// The `titles` will be those of the menu items of popup buttons allowing the user to define sort criteria.
/// - Important: The `count` of `titles` and `sortDescriptors` must be the same and â‰¥ 2, otherwise an exception is thrown.
/// - Parameters:
///   - sortDescriptors: The sort descriptors that the receiver will propose, each of which must have a unique `key`.
///   - titles: The titles that will show in the popup button (from top to bottom) allowing the user to select among sort attributes at a given row.
///   Each title must be unique.

/// - Parameters:
///   - session: The dragging session.
///   - tableView: The table view whose rows will be dragged.
///   - rowIndexes: The indexes of dragged rows.
///   - screenPoint: The drag point in screen coordinates
